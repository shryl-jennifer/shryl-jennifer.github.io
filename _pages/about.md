I am a Master's student in Computer Science (Autonomous Systems) at the University of Stuttgart, with a background in full-stack software engineering and a growing focus on machine learning for dynamical systems.

My current interests lie in understanding how learning-based models can reliably predict and simulate complex systems over long time horizons. In particular, I am interested in scientific machine learning, neural operators, and refinement-based approaches that improve stability, accuracy, and uncertainty awareness in learned simulators.

Before starting my Master's, I worked as a full-stack engineer in Tokyo, where I developed production systems and applied machine learning techniques in real-world environments. I am currently expanding this experience toward research, with the goal of contributing to reliable and interpretable machine learning methods for scientific and autonomous systems.
