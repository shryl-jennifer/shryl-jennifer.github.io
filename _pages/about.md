## About

I am an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Stuttgart, specializing in Autonomous Systems. My interests lie in machine learning methods for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems, with a focus on stability, generalization, and long-horizon prediction.

I am particularly interested in approaches that combine deep learning with structure-aware methods, enabling reliable prediction and decision-making in scientific and autonomous settings.

## Research interests

- Scientific machine learning and neural operators for dynamical systems  
- Stability and generalization of learning-based simulation models  
- Diffusion-inspired refinement and uncertainty-aware prediction  
- Artificial intelligence for autonomous systems, including planning and heuristic search  
- Learning-based methods for modeling physical and engineering processes
