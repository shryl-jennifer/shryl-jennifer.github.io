## About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science (Autonomous Systems) at the University of Stuttgart, with a strong background in software engineering and growing research interests in machine learning, scientific machine learning, and neural operators. My academic and professional experiences span full-stack system design, machine learning applications, and large-scale data processing, and I am particularly interested in bridging modern machine learning with real-world scientific and engineering systems.

My long-term goal is to contribute to research at the intersection of machine learning and complex dynamical systems, including neural PDE solvers, scientific simulation, and physically grounded AI models. I am especially interested in understanding how machine learning models can generalize reliably, model physical systems accurately, and enable scalable scientific discovery.
